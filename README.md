# Tradi-fusion
Tradi-fusion Refined: Evaluating and Fine-tuning the Riffusion Model for Irish Traditional Music.

# Focus of the project
The project will investigate the following research questions:
a) How can the Riffusion model be fine-tuned for generating Irish Traditional music?
b) What challenges are involved in fine-tuning the Riffusion model for Irish Traditional music?
c) Can the fine-tuned Riffusion model generate Irish Traditional music that is comparable in quality to
human-composed Irish Traditional music? If not, what is the reason?

The project is of interest to the field of music technology and artificial intelligence. It can be of interest to researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts in these fields who are interested in exploring the possibilities of AI-generated music and its potential applications.
